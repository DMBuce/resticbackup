<p>resticbackup - Restic with hooks.</p>

<h1 id="USAGE">USAGE</h1>

<p>resticbackup ACTION</p>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>When invoked as <code>resticbackup foo</code>, resticbackup will</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Run each *.pre hook. See <a href="#HOOKS">&quot;HOOKS&quot;</a> for details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Look up $RESTICBACKUP_FOO in the config. See <a href="#CONFIGURATION">&quot;CONFIGURATION&quot;</a> for details.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Run <code>restic $RESTICBACKUP_FOO</code>.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Run each *.post hook. See <a href="#HOOKS">&quot;HOOKS&quot;</a> for details.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Invoking resticbackup as <code>resticbackup_foo</code> or <code>restic_foo</code> with no other arguments is equivalent to invoking it as <code>resticbackup foo</code>.</p>

<h1 id="CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</h1>

<p>The location of the configuration directory varies depending on how resticbackup was installed. Usually it is found at /etc/resticbackup.d or /usr/local/etc/resticbackup.d .</p>

<p>The file named <code>config</code> within this directory is the config file. The format of this file is bash shell. Config options are set as shell variables, for example:</p>

<pre><code>OPTION=value</code></pre>

<p>Options that are not use the environment variable of the same name, or a default if no such environment variable is defined. Values that contain whitespace must be quoted, for example:</p>

<pre><code>OPTION=&#39;my value&#39;
OPTION=&quot;my value&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Other shell expansion rules apply. See <a>&quot;Parameters&quot; in <code>man bash</code></a> for details.</p>

<p>Each config option is described below.</p>

<p><b>RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE</b>, <b>RESTIC_PASSWORD_COMMAND</b>, <b>RESTIC_REPOSITORY</b>, <b>RESTIC_REPOSITORY_FILE</b>, etc.</p>

<ul>

<p>Config options are exported to restic&#39;s environment, so all of restic&#39;s environment variables are valid config options. See <a href="https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/040_backup.html#environment-variables">restic documentation</a> for details.</p>

</ul>

<p><b>RESTICBACKUP_*</b></p>

<ul>

<p>Each config option that starts with <code>RESTICBACKUP_</code> defines an action that can be invoked from the command line. The action&#39;s name is derived from the option name by removing <code>RESTICBACKUP_</code> and converting to lowercase. When invoking an action, the option&#39;s value is passed as arguments to restic.</p>

<p>For example, <code>RESTICBACKUP_FOO=&quot;snapshots -v&quot;</code> will cause <code>resticbackup foo</code> to run <code>restic snapshots -v</code> .</p>

</ul>

<p><b>LOG_FILE</b></p>

<ul>

<p>Controls logging behavior. Use &#39;-&#39; to log to stdout, &#39;syslog&#39; to log to syslog (requires logger), or a filename to log to a file.</p>

<p>Default: -</p>

</ul>

<p><b>Other Options</b></p>

<ul>

<p>Hooks may have their own custom options. See <a>HOOKS</a> for details.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="HOOKS">HOOKS</h1>

<p>In the same folder as the config file, there is a <code>hooks</code> directory where you can place hooks to run before or after the restic command. A hook is any executable that ends in <code>.pre</code> or <code>.post</code> . <code>resticbackup</code> will run *.pre hooks before running restic, and *.post hooks afterward.</p>

<p>Pre hooks are passed two arguments: the exit code of the last pre hook that failed (or <code>0</code> if no hooks failed), and the action about to be performed (e.g. for <code>resticbackup backup</code>, the action is <code>backup</code>). If any pre hook fails, resticbackup will exit without running the restic command.</p>

<p>Post hooks are also passed two arguments: the exit code of the restic command that was run, and the action that was performed.</p>

<p>Each hook runs in a modified environment that includes the options set in the config file.</p>

<p>Several example hooks are provided with resticbackup. Their behavior and configuration options are described below.</p>

<p><b>check-integ.post</b></p>

<ul>

<p>Does an integrity check when running <code>resticbackup prune</code>. The result of the check is written to a spool file in the same format as <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html">Check MK local checks</a>.</p>

<p>The config option controls the path to the spool file.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>CHECKMK_INTEGRITY_SPOOL</b>=/path - The path to the spool file</p>

</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><b>check-snaps.post</b></p>

<ul>

<p>Checks that the number of snapshots taken recently is above some threshold. The result of the check is written to a spool file in the same format as <a href="https://docs.checkmk.com/latest/en/localchecks.html">Check MK local checks</a>.</p>

<p>Options:</p>

<ul>

<li><p><b>CHECKMK_SNAPSHOTS_SPOOL</b>=/path - The path to the spool file</p>

</li>
<li><p><b>CHECKMK_SNAPSHOTS_THRESHOLDS</b>=period:num_crit:num_warn - The period of time to check, the warning threshold, and the critical threshold (e.g. <code>1day:6:10</code>)</p>

</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p><code>repo-mounted.pre</code></p>

<ul>

<p>Checks to make sure that <code>$RESTIC_REPOSITORY</code> is mounted before taking a backup.</p>

</ul>

<p><code>z-init-repo.pre</code></p>

<ul>

<p>Initializes the repo if it hasn&#39;t yet been initialized.</p>

</ul>

<h1 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h1>

<p>In order to use resticbackup, you will likely need to define a password and repository in the config file (usually located at /etc/resticbackup.d/config or /usr/local/etc/resticbackup.d/config).</p>

<pre><code>RESTIC_PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/resticbackup.d/password
RESTIC_REPOSITORY=/backup/restic</code></pre>

<p>You will also need to make sure that any custom actions are configured. There are two example actions in the default config:</p>

<pre><code>RESTICBACKUP_BACKUP=&quot;backup -v --exclude-file=/etc/resticbackup.d/exclude /&quot;
RESTICBACKUP_PRUNE=&quot;forget --prune --keep-hourly 12 --keep-daily 7 --keep-weekly 4 --keep-monthly 3&quot;</code></pre>

<p>These settings will run the appropriate restic subcommands when invoking <code>resticbackup backup</code> and <code>resticbackup prune</code>.</p>

<p>You can configure resticbackup to run any restic command in this way. E.g. if you were to add the following setting, <code>resticbackup snap</code> would run <code>restic snapshots</code></p>

<pre><code>RESTICBACKUP_SNAP=snapshots</code></pre>

<p>You can use symlinks to run restic commands without passing any arguments to resticbackup. For example, under many cron setups you can run <code>resticbackup backup</code> daily and <code>resticbackup prune</code> weekly with</p>

<pre><code>ln -s `which resticbackup` /etc/cron.daily/restic_backup
ln -s `which resticbackup` /etc/cron.daily/resticbackup_prune</code></pre>

<p>In the same folder as the config file, there is a <code>hooks</code> directory where you can place executable hooks to run before or after the restic command. Several example hooks are provided that implement the following features:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Check to make sure a repository is mounted before taking a backup</p>

</li>
<li><p>Initialize the repo if it hasn&#39;t yet been initialized</p>

</li>
<li><p>Do an integrity check after pruning the repository</p>

</li>
<li><p>Check that the number of snapshots taken recently is above some threshold</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of these hooks have additional configuration settings in the config file. To use a hook, remove its <code>.disabled</code> extension.</p>
